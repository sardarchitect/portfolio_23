Farm-to-Rent is designed, at its core, with community in mind.,
This program encourages using the provided infrastructure as a means for residents to not only feed themselves, but also their neighbor, friend, family, or a stranger. As long as one is willing to cultivate their produce, and there are people willing to purchase, a strong and healthy relationship can be fostered. This effect is bolstered by the proximity to the Eastern Market, and two other grocery stores in the area. If business appears to be bustling at one of the places and not the other, renters will have the opportunity to connect with these groups and sell their produce at these locations. The greenhouse in particular is designed without barriers between each unit. This can lead to a number of encounters amongst the two occupants which can lead to new friendships, knowledge, and potentially a helping hand.,
