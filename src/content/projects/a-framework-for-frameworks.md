The rights of the Native Americans have been constantly violated since the first encounter with European colonists. Today, Native reservations are exploited for their land and resources for capitalistic gains, virtually erasing their influence and footprint from this continent. Indigenous people living on reservations are disproportionately experiencing problems of poverty, connectivity, housing, education, and overall self-determination.

To address the socio-economic disparity and spatial issues within the Pueblos north of Albuquerque NM, this project aims to catalyze infrastructure development that creates the potential for new architectural configurations and urban dynamics. In pursuit of addressing the socio-economic disparity and spatial issues within the Pueblos north of Albuquerque, this project aims to catalyze infrastructure development that creates the potential for new architectural configurations and urban dynamics.

Through navigating within law, policies, economic incentives, and the cultural context, the project proposes to create a unified Pueblo body, the Middle Rio Grande Pueblo Initiative, that advocates for Indigenous priorities to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  MRGPI works closely with lawyers, architects, and politicians to prioritize infrastructure development through budgetary allocations, and collective transformations. Simultaneously, the Initiative implements economically and environmentally sustainable spatial productions that all help create an inter-tribal economy. By doing so, the project speculates a decrease in heavy-dependency on the BIA, and an increase in tribal sovereignty,

Simultaneously, the Initiative implements economically and environmentally sustainable spatial productions that all help create an inter-tribal economy. It works on multiple scales: the building, the property, the urban, and the regional. By doing so, the project  a decrease in heavy-dependency on the BIA and an increase in tribal sovereignty and self-determination.,
