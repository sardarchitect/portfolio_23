Conventional residential complexes contain self-centered units that usually inhibit any kind of interaction with other neighboring units. Even if the architect provides social space(s), the intrinsic nature of being self-sustaining (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, etc. all being in the same unit), gives room to creating a very individualistic lifestyle.,
     
These separate living environments create social bubbles within the life of the inhabitants, which may or may not be desirable. By challenging this conventional configuration of a solid-void relationship between the public and private space within each residential unit, an alternative living environment can be cultivated through the use of explosions and fragmentations of the program.,
