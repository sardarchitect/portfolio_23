Throughout history, the bazaar has been the backdrop for not only trade, commerce, and innovation, but also for politics, rhetoric, and exchange of ideas. This has rarely been the case with contemporary, capital-driven spatial typologies, like the American strip-mall.,
Through introducing a bazaar typology in the American urban-condition, this project tries to advocate for a human-centric buyer-seller relationship, via an economy of scale. The introduction of a formal and informal theater provides a layer of anchorage to bring people in, providing a medium for the spread of ideas.,
Formally, the vaulted ceiling-condition not only recalls the ancient typology of a bazaar, but also helps the visual distribution of spaces within the super structure. The periphery of the poch√® supports service areas, while the core opens up for circulation and flexible programming.,
