My work on understanding the intricacies of AI began after realizing so much of my work as an architectural designer can be automatized.,
I took a leap of faith in the AI communtiy, and have found it to be immensly supportive of my goals. I took steps to understand topics in discrete mathematics, statistics, probability theory, and data structures + algorithms.,
Additionally, I moved into studying the fundamentals of neural networks, deep learning, and computer vision. I used self-learning as the primary method because of the massive amounts of resources available online. For computer vision, I completed Justin Johnson's <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/" targer="_blank">EECS 598 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision</a> course, including the posted assignments. It employed the methodologies of Stanford's CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, but with a hybrid approach through PyTorch.,
I am currently unpacking certain projects that employ AI within architecture. Some of these projects are listed below.,
<li><a href="http://stanislaschaillou.com/articles.html" target="_blank">AI + Architecture by Stanislas Chaillou</li>
<li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328280126_Architectural_Drawings_Recognition_and_Generation_through_Machine_Learning" target="_blank">Architectural Drawings Recognition and Generation through Machine Learning
by Weixin Huang and Hao Zheng</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004" target="_blank">Pix2Pix by Philip Isola, et. al.</li>
<li><a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html" target="_blank">Data-driven Interior Plan Generation for Residential Buildings by Wenming Wu, et. al.</li>,
My long term goals are to democratize the use of AI within the design field. I believe that the development of such powerful technology within spacemaking should be in the hands of architects and planners rather than the big tech companies.
