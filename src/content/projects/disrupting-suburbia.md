American suburbanization has created an uneventful dystopia that lacks pedestrian anchorage, walk-ability, and social infrastructure. This car-dependent, developer-oriented sub-urbanization also creates spaces that economically disincentivize lower-income housing, gives way to sprawl, and promotes longer commutes.,
This project creates a disruption within the critiqued American suburbia by introducing a society of “DIY Makers” similar to the type proposed by Adam Greenfield in Toward a New Political Economy of Matter. By providing tools for manufacturing within a spatial rule-set, this project predicts a new sub-urban typology for a community-based development.,
This new form of urbanism stays cohesive and structured in form, yet becomes organic in behavior. The project speculates the introduction of markets, cafes, residential quarters, and employment opportunities, providing a re-densification of suburbia at a smaller scale.,
