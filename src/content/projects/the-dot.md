The dot (The Development on Troy) is a mixed-use parking, retail, and office development in Downtown Ferndale.,
It is a mixed-use building with 2 floors of office space, 1 floor for retail shops, and 5 levels of parking, right in the heart of downtown Ferndale,
My work within this project had to do with construction management, responding to contractor RFIs, and drafting office layouts.
