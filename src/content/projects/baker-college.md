Baker College is a private college in Michigan, founded in 1911. It has since grown to span multiple cities within Michigan, and this project is the College's most recent urban campus.,
This 8-story building is located in downtown Royal Oak, Michigan, and has a total area of about 80,000 square feet. There are two floors dedicated to parking, and the rest are classrooms, terraces, and office spaces.,
I played a multi-faceted role in this project; making key conceptual design decisions, preparing design development documents, answering RFIs, and coordinating with sub-contractors.
